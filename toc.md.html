# Part 1 - General Programming of a GPU

## Get Started

We'll set up the working environment in Windows more like how you'd expect
coming from other programming environments. When we're done you won't have to
think about configuration or Windows again. We don't need a large, complicated
IDE. It's just you and your editor, writing code that runs directly on the CPU
without any layers in between. We'll also tighten up the loop from writing code,
to running the program, to debugging. As a bonus, we'll get the graphics
debugger RenderDoc installed and use that to poke at a real graphics program.

## Creating a window on Windows

Since our ultimate goal is getting the GPU to draw things on the screen, our
first significant task is getting a fully functional window open. We'll do that
using just the Win32 Windows API. This gets us used to working with the Win32
API, which has an unfair reputation of being difficult. We'll also get practice
working in C++ with an achievable goal.

## Bootstrapping Vulkan

With a fully functional window under our control, our next goal is the initial
steps for using Vulkan. We'll get the SDK, add it to our project, and call the
initial functions that initialize Vulkan. We will enable our first and most
important Vulkan feature, the validation layers. These provide feedback on
proper usage of the Vulkan API, warning us when we aren't doing things according
to the specification. Also relating to the Vulkan specification, we'll learn how
to reference, navigate and read the Vulkan specification, which will be our
primary source of information throughout the rest of our journey.

## Setting up communication to the GPU

After getting Vulkan initialized, we can start setting up the process of sending
commands to the GPU. I'll introduce a technique we'll uses frequently for
approaching Vulkan concepts; finding the Vulkan functions which get us to where
we want and working backwards from there. We will learn a bit about how the GPU
works through issuing commands on a queue. Throughout this whole process we will
see how the Vulkan validation system informs and guides us to making a well
formed program.

## Constructing a job system

Until recently, real time graphics programming centered around the idea of
rendering a frame. The entire program runs in a loop of drawing frames, with all
other aspects of the program contained within that loop. Since hitting the
limitations of increasing processing speed, processor designers have instead
created independent multiple cores in one processing package. To get the best
performance possible, programmers must utilize all the cores available
concurrently. Tying together the idea of a main rendering loop while
synchronizing concurrent programming across processing cores becomes difficult.
If done incorrectly it could lead to worse performance than just using a single
core. Here, we'll build the foundations of a scalable job processing system,
providing a way out of the normal rendering loop.

## Shifting the concept of a frame

With a working job system in place, we can shift a normal loop of rendering
frames to a snapshot of a running system. We'll invert the concept of a frame
being the governing element of the system to just another job in the queue. That
job begins the process creating a visual snapshot of the system at that moment
of time.

## Converting the renderer to jobs

We're still not utilizing the job system effectively. We've transitioned out of
a normal frame based rendering loop, but the rendering system is still a linear
sequence of operations. We'll break apart the components of the renderer
into interconnected jobs to get the most performance possible.
